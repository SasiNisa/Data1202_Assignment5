# YouTube Data Analysis

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing YouTube data of 4000 subscribers. The script loads a dataset, performs analysis, and exports results to a CSV file. Additionally, it includes functionality to load data into a MySQL database table.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
To get started with this project, follow these steps:  These steps will set up the project, run the analysis, and review the results.

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command. You can do this using bash.

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

2. **Install Dependencies**: You have to be installed Python on your system.  Additionally, you'll need to install the pandas library. You can install it in bash with the following command.
    pip install pandas

3. **Download Dataset**: Download the YouTube dataset (`YouTube.csv`) and place it in the project directory.

4. **Open Jupyter Notebook**: open the Jupyter Notebook (`Assignment4_Group7.ipynb`) which is located in your project directory using Jupyter Notebook or Google colab or in Visual studio code .

5. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the cells in the notebook to run the Python code which will perform the analysis on the YouTube dataset, print the distribution of channel types, export the top 1000 records to a CSV file, and optionally load them into a MySQL database table.

6. **Review Results**: After running the notebook, you'll see the distribution of channel types printed in the output. Additionally, a CSV file named `top_1000_records.csv` will be generated in the project directory.
